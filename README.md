## About this project

coefoodsafetytools.org is a [CDC](https://cdc.gov)-funded project of the University of Tennessee Veterinary School's [Center for Agriculture and Food Safety and Preparedness](http://www.vet.utk.edu/cafsp/).

UT, as one of the CDC's [Centers of Excellence](https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/centers/index.html), was chosen to develop coefoodsafetytools.org as a clearing-house for all of the documentation, media, and other educational resources developed by all of the five Food Safety Centers of Excellence across the country.
